<strong>A project to practice responsive design, working with the DOM and deployment.</strong>

At the end of the first week of the School of Code bootcamp - in which we'd learned the basics of JS - we were tasked with making a rock, paper, scissors game one afternoon. Which we did, without any styling, making use of inputs and popups.

16 weeks later, having graduated the bootcamp, I challenged myself to use this code and test / develop my knowledge of responsive design, working with the DOM to dynamically access and update the structure of a webpage, and deploying.

This super-exciting game of rock paper scissors is available for you to test <a href="https://rps-mrb.vercel.app/" target="_blank">here</a>! 

It wont win any awards for styling or gameplay! But I'm pleased that I got to grips with media query to make the page presentable on vertical mobile and on desktop, with the use of JS to update elements and textcontent via the DOM, and that it's a real live site that anyone can visit!

I'd love to come back to this from time to time. Next steps will be to ensure responsiveness horizontally on mobile and on tablets, and to work on some more interesting design features. Perhaps even connectint to an SQL database and adding auth to keep a high score!?
